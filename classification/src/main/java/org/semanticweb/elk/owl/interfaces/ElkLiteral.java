/**
 * Corresponds to a
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Literals" >Literal<a> in the OWL 2
 * specification.
 * 
 * The OWL specification distinguishes three specific kinds of literals: typed
 * literals, plain literals without language tag, and plain literals with
 * language tag. However, plain literals are identified with typed literals of
 * type "rdf:PlainLiteral" where the language tag is represented as part of the
 * lexical form. For example, "Some text"@de is represented as "Some text@de"
 * ^^rdf:PlainLiteral and "Another text" is represented as "Another text@"
 * ^^rdf:PlainLiteral. These forms are considered structurally identical.
 * 
 * Therefore, all literals can be considered as consisting of a lexical form and
 * a datatype.
 * 
 * Also note that the semantic interpretation of literals is not part of the
 * structural model of OWL. For example, the literals "1"^^xsd:integer,
 * "+1"^^xsd:integer, and "1"^^xsd:shortint are all different.
